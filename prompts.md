# Vibe Coding Prompts Log

## Lesson 1
- Goal: Learn Git basics (diff → stage → commit → push) and set up a prompts log.
- Prompt: "Explain Git simply and guide me through first repo setup on Windows."
- Result: Repo created, cloned, commits pushed, README updated.
- What I learned: Working directory vs staged changes; git diff; small commits.
